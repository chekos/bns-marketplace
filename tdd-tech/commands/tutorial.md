$ARGUMENTS

Create a comprehensive tutorial outline following these steps:

## 1. Topic Analysis

First, analyze the topic to understand:
- **Core concept**: What is the main thing being taught?
- **Audience level**: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- **Prerequisites**: What should readers already know?
- **Estimated time**: How long will this take to complete?

## 2. Research Phase

Search for:
- Current best practices for this topic
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Related tutorials (to differentiate our approach)
- Latest version/syntax for any tools involved

## 3. Generate Tutorial Outline

Produce an outline in this format:

```markdown
# [Tutorial Title]

## Metadata
- **Audience**: [Level]
- **Prerequisites**: [List]
- **Time**: ~X minutes
- **Technologies**: [List with versions]

## Learning Outcomes
