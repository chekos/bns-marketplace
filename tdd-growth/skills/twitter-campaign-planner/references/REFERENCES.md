## X Algorithm Source Code (Phoenix Architecture)

Official open-source algorithm repository:
- [X Algorithm Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/xai-org/x-algorithm) - Phoenix architecture with Grok-based transformer
- `/tmp/x-algorithm/home-mixer/scorers/author_diversity_scorer.rs` - Author diversity scoring (exponential decay for repeated authors)
- `/tmp/x-algorithm/home-mixer/scorers/oon_scorer.rs` - Out-of-network scoring and reach factors
- `/tmp/x-algorithm/home-mixer/scorers/weighted_scorer.rs` - Engagement signal weights

**Key insight from source**: Author Diversity Scorer applies exponential decay to repeated author content, penalizing echo chamber engagement patterns.
