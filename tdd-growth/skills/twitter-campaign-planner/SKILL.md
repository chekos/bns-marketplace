# Twitter Campaign Planner Skill

## Campaign Types

| Campaign | Duration | Goal | Key Metric |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| Newsletter launch | 1 week | Subscriber spike | Signups |
| Content series | 2-4 weeks | Audience growth | Follower rate |
| Engagement sprint | 2 weeks | Algorithm favor | Reply rate |
| Brand awareness | Ongoing | Reach | Impressions |

## Posting Cadence

### Minimum Viable Presence
- 1 post/day for algorithm visibility
- Engage with 20+ accounts in niche daily

### Growth Mode
- 3-5 posts/day
- 2-3 long-form articles/week (Premium) — highest performing format
- 50+ meaningful replies/day ("reply guy" strategy)
- Threads optional for variety (long-form outperforms)

### Timing
- Best times: 9-11 AM, 7-9 PM (PST)
- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday
- Post when followers are online (check analytics)

## Weekly Content Mix

```
Monday: Long-form article (educational deep dive)
Tuesday: Engagement post (question, poll, hot take)
Wednesday: Long-form article (industry insight or tutorial)
Thursday: Behind-the-scenes or personal
Friday: Curated content (share others' work) or long-form
Weekend: Light engagement, replies only
```

Note: Long-form articles outperform threads. Default to long-form for educational content.

## Content Pillars for tacosdedatos

| Pillar | % of Content | Examples |

## The "Reply Guy" Strategy

High-effort, high-return tactic for small accounts:

```
Daily Actions:
1. Find 5-10 larger accounts in your niche (data viz, Python, Spanish tech)
2. Reply with value: insights, helpful additions, thoughtful questions
3. NOT: "Great post!" or generic agreement
4. Aim for 50+ quality replies/day

Expected Results:
- 8K+ impressions/day
- Profile visits from larger audiences
- Algorithm recognition as active participant
```

## Metrics to Track

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Posting and ghosting** — Must engage in first hour after posting
- **Same content everywhere** — Adapt for platform, don't cross-post verbatim
- **Hashtag stuffing** — Max 1-2, often zero is better
- **Link-only posts** — Always add compelling caption/insight
- **Ignoring replies** — Every reply is an opportunity
- **Inconsistent schedule** — Algorithm favors reliability
