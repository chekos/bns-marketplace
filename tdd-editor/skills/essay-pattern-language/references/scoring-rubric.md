# Scoring Rubric

This rubric provides specific criteria for scoring each of the 27 patterns on a 1-5 scale.

## Score Definitions

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1** | Absent/Broken | Pattern not present or actively hurts the essay |
| **2** | Weak | Pattern attempted but ineffective or inconsistent |
| **3** | Competent | Pattern present and functional, nothing special |
| **4** | Strong | Pattern executed well, contributes meaningfully |
| **5** | Masterful | Pattern executed brilliantly, elevates the whole |

## Calibration Notes

- **Most essays score 2-3 on most patterns.** A score of 3 is respectable.
- **Scores of 4 require specific justification.** What makes this noticeably good?
- **Scores of 5 are rare.** Reserve for truly exceptional execution.
- **Scores of 1 mean active harm.** Not just absence, but damage.
- **Be consistent across patterns.** Don't grade some hard and others easy.
