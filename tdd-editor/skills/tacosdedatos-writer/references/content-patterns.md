## Content Philosophy

The content reveals a unique position: a bilingual technical educator who prioritizes practical application over theory, uses personal experience as primary evidence, and consistently advocates for AI as a creative amplifier rather than replacement. The writing bridges technical depth with accessibility, maintaining a distinctive voice that combines Mexican cultural identity with Bay Area tech culture.
