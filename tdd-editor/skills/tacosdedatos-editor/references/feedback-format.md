# Feedback Format

Templates and guidelines for delivering editorial feedback effectively.

## Core Principles

1. **Be specific**: Quote passages, don't speak in generalities
2. **Explain the why**: Don't just say "fix this"—explain the impact
3. **Lead with strengths**: Authors need to know what's working too
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Maximum 3 priority actions
5. **Stay constructive**: Guide, don't take over

## Standard Review Format

### Template: Full Editorial Review

```markdown
# Editorial Review: [Title]

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict**: [Ready / Needs Revision / Major Restructuring Required]

[2-3 sentence summary. What's the core strength? What's the primary concern?]

---

## What's Working

These elements are strong and should be preserved:

- **[Element]**: [Why it works]
- **[Element]**: [Why it works]
- [Quote a particularly effective passage]

---

## Structural Feedback

### [Issue Title]

**What**: [Describe the structural issue]
**Where**: [Section/location]
**Impact**: [Why this matters for the reader]
**Suggestion**: [How to approach the fix]

[Repeat for each structural issue, max 3]

---

## Voice Notes

### Passage 1

> "[Quote the problematic text]"

**Issue**: [Too formal / Generic / Missing grounding / etc.]
**Why it doesn't work**: [Explain]
**Reframe direction**: [Suggestion or example]

[Repeat for key passages, max 3-4]

---

## Priority Actions

Fix these three things first:

1. **[Most critical]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Second priority]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Third priority]**: [Brief description]

---

## Next Steps

[Ready for copy-edit / Return for revision / Schedule discussion]
```

---

## Variant Templates

### Template: Light Review (Almost Ready)

For pieces that need only minor adjustments.

```markdown
# Editorial Review: [Title]

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict**: Ready (with minor notes)

[One sentence on why this is ready. One sentence on the small tweaks.]

---

## Quick Notes

1. **[Small issue]**: [Specific fix]
2. **[Small issue]**: [Specific fix]

---

## What's Working

[2-3 bullet points on strengths to preserve]

---

## Next Steps

Ready for copy-edit after addressing notes above.
```

### Template: Major Revision Needed

For pieces with fundamental issues.

```markdown
# Editorial Review: [Title]

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict**: Major Restructuring Required

[What's the core problem? Why can't this publish as-is?]

---

## The Core Issue

[Explain the ONE fundamental problem. Don't overwhelm with everything wrong.]

**What's happening**: [Describe]
**Why it's not working**: [Explain impact]
**What needs to change**: [Direction, not detailed prescription]

---

## What to Preserve

Despite the structural issues, these elements are strong:

- [Element to keep]
- [Element to keep]

---

## Suggested Approach

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

---

## Next Steps

[Return for revision / Schedule call to discuss]
```

---

## Voice Feedback Formats

### Format: Specific Passage Reframe

```markdown
### Original

> "[Quote the problematic text exactly]"

### Issue

[Explain what's wrong: too formal, generic, missing vulnerability, etc.]

### Direction

[Don't rewrite for them—give direction]

Example direction, not prescription:
- Add a personal stake or admission
- Ground with a specific example from your experience
- Drop the "No es X. Es Y" structure—just say Y
```

### Format: Pattern Alert

For recurring voice issues.

```markdown
### Pattern: [Name the pattern]

I noticed this pattern in several places:

**Examples**:
- "[Quote 1]"
- "[Quote 2]"
- "[Quote 3]"

**What's happening**: [Explain the pattern]

**General fix**: [Direction for all instances]
```

---

## Structural Feedback Formats

### Format: Opening Needs Work

```markdown
### Opening Reconstruction

**Current structure**:
- Line 1: [What it does]
- Line 2: [What it does]
- Line 3: [What it does]

**What's missing**: [Spark / Stakes / Zoom / Thesis]

**Direction**:
Consider opening with [suggestion]. The stakes don't land until paragraph 3—pull that tension forward.

**Reference**: See structure-patterns.md for the 4-beat opening formula.
```

### Format: Dead Zone Alert

```markdown
### Dead Zone: [Section Name]

**Location**: [Where in the piece]
**Length**: [How long]

**Problem**: This section is [abstract philosophy without examples / technical depth without context / list without narrative].

**Fix direction**:
[Suggest what kind of content would revive this section—personal stake, concrete example, code block, etc.]
```

### Format: Closing Needs Reframe

```markdown
### Closing: Recap → Reframe

**Current closing**:
> "[Quote current closing]"

**Issue**: This summarizes what we covered. Closings should reframe—give readers a new lens, not a recap.

**Reframe direction**:
What's the "so what"? What new possibility does this open? Try: "La próxima vez que [common situation], recuerda: [new lens]"
```

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

- Quote specific passages
- Explain the impact, not just the issue
- Offer direction, not prescription
- Prioritize (max 3 priority actions)
- Acknowledge what's working
- Be direct but kind

### Don't

- Say "this needs work" without specifics
- Rewrite passages for the author
- List every small issue
- Ignore strengths
- Use vague language ("could be stronger")
- Overwhelm with feedback

---

## Feedback Tone Examples

### Too Vague

> "The opening doesn't work."

### Too Harsh

> "This opening is boring and doesn't grab attention at all."

### Just Right

> "The opening presents useful context, but the spark is buried in paragraph 2. Consider leading with 'Tenía Lucky Strikes y café Andatti'—that image creates immediate curiosity."

### Too Prescriptive

> "Change the opening to: 'Este fin de semana descubrí algo que cambió todo.'"

### Just Right

> "The opening needs a hook. What was the moment that sparked this piece? Lead with that personal beat before the context."
