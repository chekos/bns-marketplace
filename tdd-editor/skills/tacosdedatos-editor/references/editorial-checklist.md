# Editorial Checklist

Comprehensive checklist for reviewing tacosdedatos content. Use this for systematic evaluation.

## Part 1: Developmental Review

### Opening (First 150 Words)

- [ ] **Beat 1 - Spark**: Is there a personal moment, counterintuitive claim, or vivid scene?
- [ ] **Beat 2 - Stakes**: Is it clear why this matters NOW?
- [ ] **Beat 3 - Zoom**: Does it connect to something universal?
- [ ] **Beat 4 - Thesis**: Is the destination clear?
- [ ] Stakes established within 150 words?
- [ ] Would you keep reading after the first paragraph?

### Structure

- [ ] **Clear structure type**: Is this a Transformation Arc, Deep Dive, or Reflective piece?
- [ ] **Logical flow**: Do sections build on each other?
- [ ] **Concrete → Abstract**: Does each section ground abstractions with examples?
- [ ] **Visual breaks**: Are there images, code blocks, or lists every 300-400 words?
- [ ] **Length appropriate**: Sweet spot 1,200-1,800 words; deep dives up to 2,500

### Argument Quality

- [ ] **Clear thesis**: Can you state the main argument in one sentence?
- [ ] **Evidence provided**: Are claims backed with metrics, examples, or experience?
- [ ] **No logical leaps**: Does each conclusion follow from what came before?
- [ ] **Earned insights**: Does the piece do the work to reach its conclusions?
- [ ] **Counterarguments addressed**: Are obvious objections acknowledged?

### Closing

- [ ] **Reframe, not recap**: Does it offer a new lens, not a summary?
- [ ] **Single CTA**: Is there one clear action for readers?
- [ ] **Emotional landing**: Does it leave the reader with a feeling, not just information?
- [ ] **Forward momentum**: Does it point toward possibility?

### Pacing

- [ ] **No dead zones**: Are there long stretches without examples, code, or personal connection?
- [ ] **Momentum maintained**: Does interest build or stay flat?
- [ ] **Breathing room**: Is there enough white space and formatting?
- [ ] **Transition quality**: Are section transitions smooth or jarring?

## Part 2: Voice Authenticity Review

### Language Balance

- [ ] **Spanish-first**: Is the primary language Spanish?
- [ ] **Justified English**: Is English only used for untranslatable tech terms?
- [ ] **Natural code-switching**: Does language mixing feel organic?
- [ ] **No ridiculous translations**: Are terms like "deploy" and "shipping" kept in English?

### Vulnerability + Expertise

- [ ] **Failures before successes**: Does the author share struggles first?
- [ ] **Genuine uncertainty**: Are there admitted unknowns?
- [ ] **Confident but humble**: Is there authority without arrogance?
- [ ] **Process shown**: Is the messy middle visible, not just polished outcomes?

### Cultural Grounding

- [ ] **Specific references**: Are cultural anchors specific (not generic "Latino culture")?
- [ ] **Authentic metaphors**: Do comparisons feel real, not forced?
- [ ] **Peer-to-peer tone**: Is it "tú" not "usted"?
- [ ] **Taquería test**: Does it sound like catching up with a friend?

### Anti-AI Markers

Check for and flag these patterns:

**Generic phrases to remove:**
- "It's important to note"
- "In conclusion"
- "Furthermore"
- "Obviously"
- "Simply"
- "As we can see"

**Empty antitheses to rewrite:**
- "No es X. Es Y." (when there's no real contrast)
- "No reemplazamos X. Lo expandimos."
- "Esto no es X. Esto es Y."

**Missing personality:**
- Could this paragraph appear in any tech blog?
- Is there any personal stake visible?
- Are there specific details or only generalities?

### Voice Rules Check

1. [ ] Humanizes the technical (complex concepts get metaphors/stories)
2. [ ] Anti-hype positioning (calls out "sobre-ingeniería")
3. [ ] Conversational formatting (dashes, bullets, breathing room)
4. [ ] Time consciousness (relates to time saved/invested)
5. [ ] Practical over theoretical (real code, specific tools)
6. [ ] Humor present (self-deprecating jokes to lower barriers)

## Part 3: Engagement Assessment

### Personal + Technical Balance

- [ ] **Vulnerability present**: Is there a personal, relatable element?
- [ ] **Technical substance**: Is there enough depth for practitioners?
- [ ] **Balance achieved**: Neither pure confession nor dry tutorial?

### Transformation Story

- [ ] **Clear before state**: What was the problem/situation?
- [ ] **Clear after state**: What changed?
- [ ] **Specific metrics**: Are achievements quantified?
- [ ] **Reader can see themselves**: Is the transformation relatable?

### Shareability Factors

- [ ] **Counterintuitive take**: Does it challenge conventional wisdom?
- [ ] **Quotable line**: Is there a memorable phrase to share?
- [ ] **Actionable framework**: Is there something readers can copy-paste or use immediately?
- [ ] **Emotional peak**: Is there a vulnerable moment or triumph?

### Reader Journey

- [ ] **Hook (0-10 sec)**: Does the opening create immediate curiosity?
- [ ] **Revelation (10-30 sec)**: Is the mechanism behind the hook revealed?
- [ ] **Learning (30 sec-2 min)**: Are there concrete examples and implementations?
- [ ] **Inspiration (2-3 min)**: Does the reader see new possibilities?
- [ ] **Action (3+ min)**: Are there specific next steps?
- [ ] **Community (end)**: Is there an invitation to participate?

### Dead Zone Check

Flag if present:
- [ ] Long theoretical sections without practical application
- [ ] Technical deep dives without explaining the "why"
- [ ] Bullet lists without connecting narrative
- [ ] Generic AI hype without specific achievements
- [ ] Multiple competing CTAs
- [ ] Pure technical content with no human element
